2. What are revision control systems?

Revision control systems are a way of backing up and keeping track of all
files within a project. This makes it easy to recover lost files, or code you
know works if you've made a change that broke your code. There is rcs, cvs,
svn and git. 

rcs commands:
ci - check in
co - check out
rcsdiff - diff (bring back the last revision) for rcs files

cvs:
add - adds a file or directory to the repository
checkout - checks out source for editing
commit - checks files into repo

svn:

propset - set properties to the file 
delete - removes a file from the repo
status - prints the status of the working directory and files.

git:

add - adds file to repo
commit - adds changes and comments to repo to be pushed
push - pushed the local git repo to a remote repository, such as one set uo on github


3.Redirecting is for dealing with reading and writing files, while piping is
for sending information between different utilities. 



4. find . -type f -exec file '{}' \;



5. What is the Unix command make, and how is it useful?
 
Make is a tool that simplifies recompiling of large programs. You need a make
file that holds the commands to check and/or compile all the different parts
of the program. When you run make then it will search for a makefile in that
directory and runs it if found.
