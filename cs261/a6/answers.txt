1. eat and ate would be the same in stringHash1 but not in stringHash 2.

2. The number of hashLinks in each bucket is reduced, making the loadFactor smaller.

3. Yes because the load Factors will be different so they will resize differently.

4. Yes. In #3 we talked about the different resizes, and if one Hash makes a resize at a time when another wouldn't, there would be different load factors.

5. Yes. Because there are different factors by which the values are hashed, there will be a different distribution of hashLinks in Buckets. 

6. Since prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and 1, there will be a wider spread distribution of remainders. Say we took 10, a non-prime. It will have certain remainders that occur more ofter than others because it's even and also a mutliple of 5. 20, a mutliple of 10, 5, 4 and 2 will be worse.
